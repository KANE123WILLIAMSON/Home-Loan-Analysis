# **Home Loan Analysis(Using Python and MySQL)**
Project Objective:-

This Home Loan Analysis Project focuses on exploring and understanding key demographic and financial factors that influence loan applications and approvals. The primary goal is to analyze patterns among applicants and visualize how various attributes affect loan dynamics, helping financial institutions and applicants make data-driven decisions.
The dataset comprises applicant information such as gender, marital status, education level, property location, income, loan amount, repayment days, and number of dependents.
